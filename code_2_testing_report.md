generating two distinct implementations for each task:
- **code_1**: The original solution.
- **code_2**: An alternative solution that accomplishes the same task in a different way.

We then automatically test both implementations to ensure correctness and consistency.

---

## Generating `code_2`
- For each task in `functions.json` that has a `code_1` but no `code_2`, we use the OpenAI API to generate a new function (`code_2`).
- The prompt instructs the model to:
  - Use the same function signature and behavior as `code_1`.
  - Implement the solution in a different style or using a different algorithm.
  - Return the new function in a strict JSON format for consistency.
- The script `add_code_2_to_functions.py` automates this process, updating the JSON file in real time for crash safety and using multithreading for speed.

---

## Automated Testing of `code_1` and `code_2`
- We use the script `test_functions.py` to validate both implementations for every task.
- **Test case generation:**
  - For each task, we use OpenAI to generate several diverse test cases based on the task description.
- **Execution:**
  - Both `code_1` and `code_2` are dynamically executed on each test case input.
  - Outputs are compared for equality.
- **Validation:**
  - For each output, we send the result to OpenAI to confirm if it matches the expected output (the model must reply with 'good' or 'bad').
- **Reporting:**
  - The script prints a summary in the terminal, marking each task as `-Okay` if all tests pass and are confirmed 'good', or showing details of any failures.

Scripts fils
- **add_code_2_to_functions.py**: Generates and appends alternative solutions (`code_2`) for each task using OpenAI.
- **test_functions.py**: Automates test case generation, runs both implementations, validates outputs, and summarizes results.
- **functions.json**: The main data file containing all tasks and their implementations.
